\section{Project description}
\subsection{Introduction}
The Traffic Simulation System can simulate various kinds of vehicles that are running on a complicated road network. The road network contains multi-lane roads, intersections and roundabouts. The user can manage the simulation by adding vehicles, setting traffic lights on chosen intersections, changing time step, and so on. The real-time situation of the traffic will help user to compare which traffic plan works better.

\subsection{Features of the system}
FE-1: The Traffic Simulation System should simulate different kinds of vehicles, including cars, buses and ambulances.\\FE-2: The Traffic Simulation System should build a road network which contains multi-lane roads, intersections and roundabouts.\\FE-3: The Traffic Simulation System should have traffic lights and allow the user to manage relevant policy to control the traffic.\\FE-4: The Traffic Simulation System should allow the user to define where the vehicles enter and leave the road network.\\FE-5: The Traffic Simulation System should allow the user to add arbitrary quantity and different kinds of vehicles into the road network at any time.\\FE-6: The Traffic Simulation System should allow the user to decide the behaviors of drivers of cars, which includes reckless behavior, cautious behavior and normal behavior.\\FE-7: The Traffic Simulation System should present real time situation of the traffic.\\FE-8: The Traffic Simulation System should allow the user to control the simulation.\\

\hline
Feature & Version1 & Version2  & Version3\\
\hline
FE-1& One type of vehicle, car which only stops when the traffic light turns red. & Tow types of vehicle, car and bus. The,bus can break shortly at the bus stop. & Three types of vehicles, car, bus and ambulance.\\
\hline
FE-2& One road which has no passing lane, and one intersection. & Multi-lane roads with intersections. & Roundabouts.\\
\hline
FE-3& One traffic light and the simple policy. & Many traffic lights and it allows the,user to set traffic light in junction. & User can choose the main road.\\
\hline
FE-4& Single entry point and exit point. & Random entry points and exit points. & Entry points and exit points are defined,by user.\\
\hline
FE-5& The system has specific number of cars. & User can add arbitrary quantity of cars,and buses. & User can add ambulances into the system.\\
\hline
FE-6& Default all behaviors as normal. & User can choose drivers? behaviors from,three,types,,reckless behavior, cautious behavior and normal,behavior. & Done.\\
\hline
FE-7& Present the color of traffic lights. & Display the average speed of all vehicles,in the simulation, number of different vehicles, different behaviors of the,drivers. & Done.\\
\hline
FE-8& The system is controlled by itself. & User can control the simulation by changing,time step and changing time for switching lights. & User can control the system by changing,the speed.\\
